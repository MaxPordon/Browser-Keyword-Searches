# Browser Search Shortcuts
[Keyword searching](https://kb.mozillazine.org/Using_keyword_searches) made easy with importable out-of-the-box html-files.

The bookmark-importable html file features:
- an extensive list of recommended, obvious Keyword Searches, such as `y` for YouTube
- multi-parameter search terms for e.g. Google Maps navigation: `navi startpoint endpoint`


# What are Keyword Searches?
As explained in [this](https://kb.mozillazine.org/Using_keyword_searches) source:

> What makes keywords very powerful is that if you add a “%s” at some place in your bookmark’s URL, it will be replaced by the words you type in after the keyword. (These are sometimes called “Quicksearches”.) For example, if we were to modify the bookmark mentioned above so that it pointed to “http://google.com/?q=%s”, we can type “g mozilla” into the Location Bar to arrive at “http://google.com/search?q=mozilla”.

### Chrome
Unfortunately, Chrome does not allow easy import of Keyword searches (or 'Site search' as Chrome calls it). They can be added manually, one-by-one though, as explained on [this Google Support page, scroll down to "How to fill out text fields"](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95426?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Csearch-engine-field%2Cshortcut-field%2Curl-with-s-in-place-of-query-field).

### Microsoft Edge
Unfortunately, the same is true for Edge as for Chrome.
